# Yona
YonaOs is a 32 bit hobby system made in C, this is my ~~3rd~~ 4th attempt at building Yona, less mistakes and new design decisions.
# Features:
  - still re-implementing them.
# General Resources:
  I made you a resources Folder.
## What I used for building the cross-compiler:
https://wiki.osdev.org/Building_GCC    
https://ayg0.github.io/gettoknow.github.io/posts/gcccrosscompiler/
## I want to play-test the OS:
- well here you go my curios friend:  
```$> docker pull 0rayne/i386.env:v1.0```
 - this image is equiped with all the tools you'll need to compile and build yona ready to Use.
